# R For Econometrics: A Modest Handbook 

**Note to Students**: This is a work in progress, check the date at the top for when this was last updated. This compiles all of my instructions, advice, and examples from econometrics class lectures regarding `R`. It also contains some advanced material that I did not or will not cover in class, but will be useful to know for future data analysis and understanding or diagnosing problems.

**Note to Everyone Else**: This guide is oriented primarily for my [Econometrics class](http://ryansafner.com/courses/econ480) at Hood College, but should be of wider use to anyone interested in learning `R` for data analysis.
