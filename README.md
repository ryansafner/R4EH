# R For Econometrics: A Modest Handbook 

**Open Source**: The raw (`.Rmd`) code used to produce this guide, along with the guide itself, are available on [GitHub](http://github.com/ryansafner/R4EH), and are updated regularly. GitHub does not automatically render HTML, so download the HTML file and open it, or view it where I host it [on my website](http://ryansafner.com/tutorial/R4EH.html). 

**Note to Students**: This is a work in progress, check the date at the top for when this was last updated. This compiles all of my instructions, advice, and examples from econometrics class lectures regarding `R`. It also contains some advanced material that I did not or will not cover in class, but will be useful to know for future data analysis and understanding or diagnosing problems. 
**Note to Everyone Else**: This guide is oriented primarily for my [Econometrics class](http://ryansafner.com/courses/econ480) at Hood College, but should be of wider use to anyone interested in learning `R` for data analysis. Lecture slides, handouts, and guides (both PDFs and source code in R Markdown) are openly available [on GitHub](http://github.com/ryansafner/ECON480/).

**See also my companion guide to using R Markdown** to more effectively manage your entire workflow (text, data analysis, tables, graphs, and citations!) in a single plain text file and make your work reproducible and shareable, hosted on [my website](http://ryansafner.com/tutorial/RMDG), with source available [on GitHub](http://github.com/ryansafner/RMDG)
